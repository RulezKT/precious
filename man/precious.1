.TH "PRECIOUS" "1" "May 2012" "" ""
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBprecious\fR \- a minimum kind of ephemeris
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
Anything less we couldn\'t do astrology with\.
.
.P
Use eden(1) for a better cli experience\.
.
.SH "USAGE"
Running precious from the command line (instead of programming JavaScript) is not the most efficient nor the most convenient, though it\'s ok too\.
.
.P
Some precious\-json(7) must be provided in one of three ways:
.
.IP "1." 4
\fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-stream\fR input though unix pipes \- all the rest can be covered with this approach too, see the double examples for equivalents\.
.
.IP
eden precious | precious \-s
.
.IP "2." 4
\fB\-f\fR or \fB\-\-file\fR followed by a json file \fB<path>\fR
.
.IP
precious \-f bin/example\.json
.
.IP
cat bin/example\.json | precious \-s
.
.IP "3." 4
\fB\-o\fR or \fB\-\-object\fR given a json string \fB<\'input\'>\fR, even if just \fB{}\fR
.
.IP
precious \-o {}
.
.IP
echo {} | precious \-s
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The streams way could do it all, with just a few extra characters typing\. Though perhaps not using Windows\.
.
.SH "HELP"
This is also a man\-page and can be read with any one of:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

man precious
precious [\-h | \-\-help]
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Help for precious\-json(7) is also available using these:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

man precious\-json
precious [\-h | \-\-help] json
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
